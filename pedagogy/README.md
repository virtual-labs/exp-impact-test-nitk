#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button. | Display objective and apparatus used.|Recall the experiment.
2.|Click on the weighing balance to ON it then click on tray to weigh 350 gram of aggregate, click on next button. |Display take coarse aggregate in a pan and measure it to 350 gram using the weighing balance. |To provide basic environment to start the experiment.
3.|Click on the sieves to arrange them in decreasing order then click on the tray with aggregate to fill the set of sieves with sample, click on next button. |Display arrange the sieves in the decreasing order of their size. Place the pan at the bottom and then add weighed quantity of coarse aggregate to the top most sieve and close the lid. |To obtain the required size of the aggregate.
4.|Click on the set of sieves to place it in the shaker then ON the shaker and allow it to shake for 10 minutes, click the next button to proceed. |Display place the set of sieves in the mechanical shaker and allow to shake for 10 minutes. |To obtain the uniform size of samples.
5.|Click on set of sieves to remove it from the shaker then collect the sample retained in 10 mm sieve, click next button. |Display collect the coarse aggregate retained on 10 mm sieve in a separate container. |To obtain the aggregate retained in 10 mm sieve.
6.|Obtain the empty weight of cylinder then click on the trowel to take the sample from the tray to fill the cylinder in 4 layers by tamping each layer for 25 times and then click on tamping rod to level the top surface, click on the, click next button. |Display note down the weight of the empty cylinder as W1. Then fill the cylinder with the aggregates retained on 10 mm sieve in 4 layers. |To fill the cylinder with aggregate.
7.|Click on the cylinder to weigh it, then click next button |Display note down the weight of the cylinder with the aggregates as W2. |To obtain the weight W2.
8.|Click on the cylinder to transfer all the aggregate to the cylinder in the setup, then click on the screw to remove it and release the hammer for 15 blows, then click on next button. |Display place the cylinder in the setup. Release the hammer in order to apply the impact load. 15 blows are given at an interval of not less 1 seconds. |To place the cylinder in position.
9.|Click on the set of sieves to arrange them then place it in the shaker, click on next button. | Display transfer the aggregates to the top sieve (2.36 mm). Place the set of sieves in the mechanical shaker and allow to shake for 10 minutes. |To carry out the test under gradually applied compressive load.
10.|Click on the set of sieves to remove it from the shaker then weigh the aggregate to obtain the weight W3, click on next button. |Display weigh the aggregate passing through 2.36 mm sieve as W3. |To obtain the weight W3 of aggregate.
11.|Enter the calculated value in the text box provided with the help of displayed formula then check the value and obtain the result. |Display observations and calculations. | To obtain Impact test value.
